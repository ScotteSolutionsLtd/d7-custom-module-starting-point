d7-custom-module-starting-point
===============================

A file structure and a few lines of example code to begin
coding your own Drupal 7 module in PHP.

After downloading and extracting the zip into the
sites/all/modules folder of your Drupal 7 website, rename
the long folder name "d7-custom-module-starting-point" into
a useful machine name for your module. Try to be as descriptive
as possible in your machine name. Try your best not to use
a machine name already taken on Drupal.org if you have plans to
create a sanbox for your module there.
